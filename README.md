## General Info to Remembre

### Structure
-   User can Read stock when not signed in
-   Once signed in, user can CRUD recipes
-   Once signed in, user can CRUD stock
-   When recipe is complete, stock of ingredients is subtracted
-   Optional -- Chef is admin, CRUD recipes, CRUD Stock. Cook is one step down, can only Read recipes
-   OPTIONAL-- waste??
-   Stock
-   Title:string, Amount:integer, Measurement:string
-   Recipes
-    Title:string, Ingredients:string, Amount:integer, Measurement:string, Instructions:string
-   Ingredients
-    Not necessary? Only Ingredient:string, Measurement:string


### Viewstates
-   Landing (signed out) page -- empty
-   Nav -- Stock, Recipes
-   On sign in, recipe table
-   Recipe Table
-   Search bar
-   Recipes clickable(R), U/D on right
-   Optional Image preview??
-   20 per page?
-   On recipe click, directs to view of recipe w/ U/D/Complete
-   Ingredients/amounts
-   Instructions
-   Stock
-   Table w/ C/U/D
-   Updates on recipe complete


### Setup your database:
    - bin/rails db:drop (if it already exists)
    - bin/rails db:create
    - bin/rails db:migrate
    - bin/rails db:seed
    - bin/rails db:examples

  Note: Remember to follow the same commands when setting up your deployed database!

### Run your server!
1. Run the API server with `bin/rails server` or `bundle exec rails server`.

## Structure

This template follows the standard project structure in Rails.

`curl` command scripts are stored in [`scripts`](scripts) with names that
correspond to API actions.

User authentication is built-in.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `bin/rails routes` lists the endpoints available in your API.
-   `bin/rails test` runs automated tests.
-   `bin/rails console` opens a REPL that pre-loads the API.
-   `bin/rails db` opens your database client and loads the correct database.
-   `bin/rails server` starts the API.
-   `scripts/*.sh` run various `curl` commands to test the API. See below.

<!-- TODO -   `rake nag` checks your code style. -->
<!-- TODO -   `rake lint` checks your code for syntax errors. -->

## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`scripts`](scripts) to test built-in actions. Add your
own scripts to test your custom API. As an alternative, you can write automated
tests in RSpec to test your API.

### Reset Database without dropping

This is not a task developers should run often, but it is sometimes necessary.

**locally**

```sh
bin/rails db:migrate VERSION=0
bin/rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```

**heroku**

```sh
heroku run rails db:migrate VERSION=0
heroku run rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```
